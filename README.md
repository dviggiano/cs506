# CS 506 Project: Echo

Group project for CS 506: Software Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Worked on an Agile Scrum team with Justin Benz, Jin Choi, Camille Forster, Aisha Mohamed, and Pinzhe Liu.

The project is not entirely finished, but several features were completed ahead of our final demonstration. I primarily worked on the project's API routes, database, and backend infrastructure, though I also contributed to the frontend by defining functions to make requests to the API. 

The frontend is built with TypeScript using the React Native Expo platform. The backend is rooted in a Flask API that interacts with a MySQL database, both of which are designed for deployment in Docker containers.

With more time, I would have liked to help render chords on the frontend, add additional constraints to the API routes, add more robust handling of database errors and concurrent operations, and document my live testing process for the API routes using Postman.
